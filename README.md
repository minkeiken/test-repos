Exploring the Power BI Desktop Solution
In this task, you will explore the Sales Analysis Power BI Desktop solution.
1. In the File Explorer window, right-click the Sales Analysis.pbix file, and then select Open.
This Power BI Desktop file connects to an on-premises SQL Server database by using DirectQuery. This means that the solution does not import any data, and every report interaction results in a live query to the database. The final solution produced in this lab will involve connecting to an Azure SQL Database.
Presently, the only connected sourced supported for Power BI Embedded are cloud sources: Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Data Warehouse and Azure HDInsight Spark.
2. In the Access a SQL Server Database dialog window, click Connect.
